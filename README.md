# Upcycle Camera

> A Raspberry Pi project. Upcycling an old camera with an HQ Camera sensor and touchscreen display.

## About

I wanted to build my own camera, making use of the [HQ Camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) for the Raspberry Pi. 

This repository contains information about the hardware and software I used to create my very own "Upcycle Camera".
